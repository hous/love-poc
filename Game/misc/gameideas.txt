Game ideas

Samurai platformer

Mechanics:

Primary
- 3-5 different stances/strikes, rock-paper-scissors versus opponents stance
- some stances/strikes end up in clashed swords, some instant kill, some wound, etc.
- one hit kills/deaths
- falling hurts legs, can't restart level, should have to commit seppuku to start over
- very tactile, harsh collisions with swordplay - should feel intense not bouncy

Secondary
- cinematic kills
- command to wipe off blade and sheathe
- disarming, draw short blade
- different blades increase range, speed, stagger
- turn blade to glint sunlight into enemies' eyes (in levels where the sun is out)
- mostly 1-on-1 fights a la Karateka, but some multiple enemy fights
- take weapons off of fallen enemies - standing near corpse shows icon, pressing button pauses game and shows weapon description
- weapons level-up based on number of kills


Story:

Start with young samurai who is assigned the task to bring a rogue daimyo to justice. First scene 
involves infiltrating the camp and fighting his way to the throne room. The daimyo surrenders, samurai
brings him back to his master, and is asked to perform the execution. [This part is controlled by the 
player and can be a different game mechanic for style purposes] 

Sound:
- traditional japanese music
- should be very minimalist
- sound effects need to be harsh like the collisions
